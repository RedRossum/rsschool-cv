Brief information about yourself
-----------------------------------

I want to get the necessary skills to get started with web development as soon as possible. But the priority is not to study the platform, but to get the ability to analyze the problem, form an algorithm for solving them, and implement this algorithm in code. In my opinion, this is programming, it does not depend on the language and determines the way of thinking.

I have learned some of the basics and have almost no practical experience, but I can compensate for this with a huge interest in development, and although my experience is modest, I think I have found my life's work. Therefore, I will be able to devote a huge amount of time to learning.

Skills
---------

* JavaScript (basic)
* HTML & CSS (basic)
* Git & GitHub
* Linux

Code examples
----------------

```
function mygcd(x,y){
    function gcd(a, b) {
    if (b === 0) {
      return a;
    }
    return gcd (b, a % b)
  }
  return gcd(y, x % y) 
}
```
